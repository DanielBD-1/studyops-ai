# AGENT_MEMORY.md — StudyOps AI

**Purpose:** Durable, append-only session memory for AI agents. Update after merged changes that affect behavior, APIs, or conventions.

**Rules:**

- Append new entries at the bottom (newest last).
- One entry per meaningful change—not per file touched.
- Do not store secrets, credentials, or full study text.
- Do not contradict PRD or ADRs; if something changed, note human approval.

## Entry Template

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — [Short title]

**Workflow:** [e.g. phase-1-foundation]
**ADR refs:** [001, 003, ...]
**Summary:** What changed and why.
**APIs affected:** [endpoints or "none"]
**Tests:** [what was added/updated]
**Pitfalls:** [optional — things the next agent should avoid]
**Follow-up:** [optional — open items]
```

## Project Baseline (2026-05-20)

**Status:** Context engineering layer created. No application code yet.

**Architecture locked by ADRs:**

- Main backend = modular monolith (001).
- Document processing = separate service (002).
- Zod for Gemini output, requests, env (003).
- Trello credentials not persisted (004).
- Manual List ID required for MVP Trello sync (005).

**Next implementation:** Phase 1 per `docs/workflows/phase-1-foundation-workflow.md` after human reviews context files.

**Known constraints:**

- Study text: 100–50,000 characters.
- Gemini timeout: 30s, no retry on timeout/validation failure.
- Session: 24h with Supabase refresh; redirect on expiry.
- Admin users: manual creation in Supabase (not self-register).

### 2026-05-20 — Context engineering layer

**Workflow:** N/A (pre-implementation)
**ADR refs:** 001–005 documented
**Summary:** Created AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, SKILLS.md, ADRs, workflows, and Claude agent definitions. Application directories not scaffolded yet.
**APIs affected:** none
**Tests:** none
**Pitfalls:** Do not scaffold frontend/backend/document-service until Phase 1 workflow is approved.
**Follow-up:** Human review of context files before Phase 1 implementation.
