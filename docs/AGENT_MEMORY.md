# AGENT_MEMORY.md — StudyOps AI

**Purpose:** Durable, append-only session memory for AI agents. Update after merged changes that affect behavior, APIs, or conventions.

**Rules:**

- Append new entries at the bottom (newest last).
- One entry per meaningful change—not per file touched.
- Do not store secrets, credentials, or full study text.
- Do not contradict PRD or ADRs; if something changed, note human approval.

## Entry Template

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — [Short title]

**Workflow:** [e.g. phase-1-foundation]
**ADR refs:** [001, 003, ...]
**Summary:** What changed and why.
**APIs affected:** [endpoints or "none"]
**Tests:** [what was added/updated]
**Pitfalls:** [optional — things the next agent should avoid]
**Follow-up:** [optional — open items]
```

## Project Baseline (2026-05-20)

**Status:** Context engineering layer created. No application code yet.

**Architecture locked by ADRs:**

- Main backend = modular monolith (001).
- Document processing = separate service (002).
- Zod for Gemini output, requests, env (003).
- Trello credentials not persisted (004).
- Manual List ID required for MVP Trello sync (005).

**Next implementation:** Phase 1 per `docs/workflows/phase-1-foundation-workflow.md` after human reviews context files.

**Known constraints:**

- Study text: 100–50,000 characters.
- Gemini timeout: 30s, no retry on timeout/validation failure.
- Session: 24h with Supabase refresh; redirect on expiry.
- Admin users: manual creation in Supabase (not self-register).

## Memory Log

<!-- Append entries below this line -->

### 2026-05-20 — Context engineering layer

**Workflow:** N/A (pre-implementation)
**ADR refs:** 001–005 documented
**Summary:** Created AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, SKILLS.md, ADRs, workflows, and Claude agent definitions. Application directories not scaffolded yet.
**APIs affected:** none
**Tests:** none
**Pitfalls:** Do not scaffold frontend/backend/document-service until Phase 1 workflow is approved.
**Follow-up:** Human review of context files before Phase 1 implementation.

### 2026-05-20 — Phase 1A project scaffold

**Workflow:** phase-1a-scaffold-workflow.md
**ADR refs:** 001 (backend module stubs), 002 (separate document-service shell)
**Summary:** Created frontend/, backend/, document-service/ with package.json, .env.example, Express health routes, Vite+React shell. React Router v6 listed in frontend deps; routes not configured. No auth, Supabase, Gemini, Trello, or feature APIs.
**APIs affected:** GET /health on backend (3001) and document-service (3002) only
**Tests:** Node built-in test runner health tests in backend/tests and document-service/tests (require npm install)
**Pitfalls:** Do not re-run Phase 1A; Foundation workflow skips Step 2, starts at Step 3. npm install pending G1 approval.
**Follow-up:** Human G1 for npm install; verify health; G4 before Phase 1 Foundation.

### 2026-05-20 — Phase 1A G1 npm install verified

**Workflow:** phase-1a-scaffold-workflow.md (Step 6–7)
**Summary:** `npm install` completed in backend, document-service, frontend. Backend and document-service `npm test` pass (Node built-in runner). Frontend `npm run build` succeeds. Live smoke: GET /health on :3001 and :3002 OK.
**Pitfalls:** Frontend npm audit reports 2 moderate issues in dev deps (vite chain)—no action in 1A unless human requests.
**Follow-up:** Await G4 (`approved — Phase 1A complete`) before Phase 1 Foundation Step 3+.

### 2026-05-20 — Phase 1A complete (G4)

**Workflow:** phase-1a-scaffold-workflow.md
**Human gates:** G0 begin 1A, G1 npm install, G4 Phase 1A complete — all satisfied
**Reviews:** Supervisor — Approved with notes (I1/I2 doc updates accepted by human). Security — Approved with notes (no critical/high). No blocking issues.
**Summary:** Scaffold closed. `frontend/`, `backend/`, `document-service/` with health checks, lockfiles, tests passing. Foundation **not started** per human instruction.
**Next:** When ready, human approves Phase 1 Foundation; Orchestrator skips Foundation Step 2 (scaffold), starts at Step 3 (Supabase & env). Track SEC-I1 (CORS), SEC-I2 (frontend npm audit), commit hygiene for dist/node_modules.
